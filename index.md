Hi there, 

I'm a cool guy (really!) stuying Electrical Engineering (now, isn't that cool!). I'm interested in in robotics, computer vision software development (check out my github), free and open source software. 
I love music (I used to play the keyboard). I play table tennis (ping pong), cricket (ofcourse! bring it on!) sometimes. I like to cook (although I don't claim I'm good, I might be sometimes..) 
In case you want to know more about me drop me a mail or catch me on Google plus 

See you,
Savant Krishna
